#### Shaping the future of translation

Our team aims at advancing understanding of modern translation process, and the impact of new approaches from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). We develop methods for systematically evaluating and improving the efficiency of different technological components and their synergies in collaborative translation workflows, creating a vision and new technologies for the next generation of computer-assisted translation systems.

With support of a Universit√§t Heidelberg Research Councils grant for our joint proposal "Collection, recording and processing linguistic and multimedia data for empirical analyses" we are creating a corpus infrastructure for research in Digital Humanities, which includes electronic corpora, linguistic and translation resources for low-resourced languages, conference interpreting transcripts and eye tracking data for computer-assisted translation and interpreting.

Our research and technology development address the challenges of a more prominent role of translation in the modern interconnected cultures and societies. We engage with two converging trends: one is that translators nowadays have moved from working on predominantly literary texts to translating industrial technical texts, localising documentation for products and services, which, as part of product, needs to be released simultaneously in multiple languages for international markets. This creates demand for collaborative automated translation of large volumes of text with tight deadlines, ensuring high quality, stylistic and terminological consistency across projects. Another trend is a much higher quality, usability and synergies between Machine Translation (MT) and other translation tools: Translation Memories, electronic corpora, terminology management and collaborative translation platforms, as well as other AI / NLP methods which may become potentially useful for translation, such as word embeddings, semantic similarity detection, sentiment analysis. As a result, there is a need to identify a most efficient use and interaction for these methods and technologies in collaborative translation workflows.

Our teaching addresses the changing role of the translator in modern industrial environment, where companies start looking not only for people with excellent language skills, but also for the technology specialists for translation teams, who can 'connect the dots' in the translation workflows and become advisers on the process management and technology development. For example, they should be able to evaluate usability of translation tools or the efficiency of the workflow, design specifications for next generation of translation technologies, combine necessary components and approaches, linguistic specifications, e.g., for designing a simplified technical controlled language for their domain, initiating technological linguistic solutions for their team on automatic authoring and conformity checks in the controlled language. Translation technology specialists will be able to evaluate MT quality, post-editing effort, usability, for a specific project, client or domain, as well as suggest ways to improve this quality, e.g., via customising MT, multi-engine combination of systems, optimising the design of the workflow, building relevant linguistic resources for a low-resourced language and / or domain, to systematically identify errors and to design automated correction procedures for error-critical areas of MT.

Our students are becoming a new generation of translators, who understand both translation and technologies, are aware of the industrial requirements and challenges for the translation process, know current tools and their limitations. They also can communicate the need for and initiate the development of new technological solutions, e.g., systematically identifying ..
